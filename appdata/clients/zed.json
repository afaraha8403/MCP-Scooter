  "about": "## Zed Editor\n\nZed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor built in Rust, featuring native support for both MCP (Model Context Protocol) and ACP (Agent Client Protocol) for AI-powered development.\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n- **Lightning Fast** - Written in Rust for maximum performance\n- **Real-time Collaboration** - Built-in multiplayer editing\n- **MCP Support** - Connect external context sources via MCP servers\n- **ACP Support** - Integrate full AI agents (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex)\n\n### Protocol Support\n\n#### MCP (Model Context Protocol)\nConnect context servers for additional data sources. Configure via extensions or `settings.json` under `context_servers`.\n\n#### ACP (Agent Client Protocol)\nIntegrate external AI agents that can edit code, run commands, and more. Agents appear in Zed's Agent Panel with full editing capabilities.\n\n### Supported Agents (via ACP)\n\n- **Gemini CLI** - Google's agent with visual diff review (v0.201.5+)\n- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's agent via `acp-claude-code` bridge\n- **Codex** - OpenAI's open-source agent with official adapter\n\n### Recent Features (2025-2026)\n\n- **Gemini CLI Integration** - Real-time visualizations, multi-buffer review, patch workflows\n- **Claude Code Support** - Community bridge for Claude Code agent\n- **Codex Integration** - Official open-source adapter\n- **Token-Based Pricing** - Flexible AI usage billing\n\n### Agent Panel Features\n\n- Real-time edit visualizations\n- Multi-buffer review across files\n- Preview and accept/reject patches\n- Pull request-style workflows\n\n### Configuration\n\nAdd MCP servers in `settings.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"context_servers\": {\n    \"mcp-scooter\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:6277/profiles/work/sse\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
