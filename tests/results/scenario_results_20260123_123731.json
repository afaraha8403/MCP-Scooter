The distinction between required and optional parameters is clear.\n- The descriptions for the tools accurately describe their functionality.\n- I initially made a mistake when using `scooter_add` because I forgot to specify the `tool_name` parameter. It would be helpful if the error message was more specific about which parameter was missing.\n- The `brave-search` tool is a good resource for finding general information.",

They seem to require arguments to be passed in a specific way that isn't obvious.\n- The error messages are not particularly helpful. \"Tool not found\" for `scooter_add` is misleading when the issue is actually with missing or incorrect arguments. The \"Tool 'github' is not allowed for this profile\" message is more helpful, but it would be better if I had some way to know in advance which tools are allowed.\n- The lack of clear documentation or examples for how to use these tools makes them difficult to use effectively. Providing example calls for each tool would significantly improve usability.\n- It would be helpful to have a tool that combines the functionality of `scooter_find` and `scooter_add` into a single step, making it easier to discover and enable tools.",
