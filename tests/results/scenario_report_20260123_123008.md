# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260123_123008

## Natural Web Search ❌
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I do not have access to the information requested using the available tools. I attempted to use the `scooter_execute` tool to find the answer, but it is designed to route to other tools and doesn't have the capacity to answer general knowledge questions.

---

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Find a popular GitHub repository for 'mcp-server' and tell me its primary language.

**Summary**: I initially attempted to use `scooter_find` to discover tools related to "mcp-server". This failed due to a serialization error. I then tried `scooter_execute` in hopes it could route my request to the appropriate tool, but this also failed because the tool was not found. Since the base tools are not working, I cannot proceed with the request.

## Capability Discovery ❌
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: None

---

## Graceful Failure ❌
**Task**: Order me a pepperoni pizza from the nearest Domino's.

**Summary**: None
