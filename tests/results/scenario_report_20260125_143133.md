# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260125_143133

## Natural Web Search ❌
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I was asked to find out who created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when it was announced. I started by searching for relevant tools and found the `brave-search` tool. I activated this tool and then attempted to use its `brave_web_search` function to find the answer. However, I ran into repeated errors when trying to call the tool, and I am unable to proceed. I am not sure what I am doing wrong.

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Search for 'github mcp-server' and tell me the name of GitHub's official MCP server repository.

**Summary**: I first tried to find the github tool and then activate it. After activating the github tool, I tried to use the search_repositories tool to search for "mcp-server". However, I received an error message "Error executing tool scooter_call: Tool 'scooter_call' not found.". I tried multiple times, but it didn't work. I then deactivated and reactivated the github tool, but it still didn't fix the issue. I tried to find the github took again, but to no avail.

## Capability Discovery ✅
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I used the `scooter_find` tool to search for tools related to "search". This returned a list of tools including "brave-search", "context7", and "github". Since I'm looking for academic papers, "brave-search" seems like the most relevant tool to investigate further.

## Graceful Failure ✅
