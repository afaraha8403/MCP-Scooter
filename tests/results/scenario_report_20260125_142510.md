# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260125_142510

## Natural Web Search ❌
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I attempted to find the creator and announcement date of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using the available tools. I started by using the `scooter_find` tool to identify relevant tools, then activated the `brave-search` tool. I then repeatedly attempted to use the `brave_web_search` tool via the `scooter_call` API endpoint, but each attempt resulted in an error indicating that the tool 'scooter_call' was not found. This was due to a misunderstanding of how the `scooter_call` function works. Although brave-search appears to be activated correctly and I have constructed the correct call structure, the call continues to fail. I have listed the active tools to confirm activation.

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Search for 'github mcp-server' and tell me the name of GitHub's official MCP server repository.

**Summary**: I first tried to use scooter_find to find the github tool and then activate it. After activating I tried to use the github search_repositories tool to find the github mcp-server repository. However, I continued to get the error "Tool 'scooter_call' not found. Use scooter_find to discover available tools." meaning I was not correctly calling the tool. I then tried deactivating and reactivating the github tool, but still had errors and am not finding the mcp-server repository name. I am stopping here.

## Capability Discovery ✅
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I first tried to use `scooter_find` with the query "search" to discover available search tools. However, the tool calls resulted in errors. I then tried to list active tools, but this too returned an error so I cannot determine what tools I have available at this time.

## Graceful Failure ✅
**Task**: Order me a pepperoni pizza from the nearest Domino's.

**Summary**: None
