# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260123_130728

## Natural Web Search ✅
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I first searched for the Model Context Protocol amongst the available tools. Then, I added the brave-search tool to my active tools. I used Brave Search to find when the Model Context Protocol was announced. Based on the search results, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol in November 2024.

## Natural Code Search ✅

**Summary**: From the search results, I can see that the official GitHub MCP server repository is github/github-mcp-server.

## Capability Discovery ✅
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I used the `scooter_find` tool to search for tools that can help me with searching. The results show that I have access to "brave-search" and "github". "brave-search" includes the "brave_web_search" function, which I can use for general web searches. I'll use that since I don't have a dedicated academic search tool currently.

## Graceful Failure ✅
