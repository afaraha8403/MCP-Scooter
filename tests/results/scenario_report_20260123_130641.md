**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I first searched for "Model Context Protocol" using the `scooter_find` tool to see if any tools were specifically designed for working with MCP. I then used the `brave_web_search` tool to search for the company that created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when it was announced.

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Find a popular GitHub repository for 'mcp-server' and tell me its primary language.

**Summary**: The search results show the official GitHub MCP Server at github.com/github/github-mcp-server. Since I cannot reliably determine the language using the available tools, I will respond with the repository, but I will not be able to determine primary language.

## Capability Discovery ✅
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I first checked the active tools using `scooter_list_active()` and found that `brave-search` is active, which includes the `brave_web_search` tool. I then used `brave_web_search` to search for 'academic papers'. The search returned links to Google Scholar, JSTOR, and other academic resources.
