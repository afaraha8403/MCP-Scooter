## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Find a popular GitHub repository for 'mcp-server' and tell me its primary language.

**Summary**: I am still unable to use `scooter_find`. Since I cannot find a tool to accomplish this task, I must respond with NOT_FOUND.

## Capability Discovery ❌
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I tried to use the `scooter_find` tool to search for tools that can help with academic paper searches and other search functionalities. However, I encountered an error while executing the tool, indicating that the response could not be serialized to JSON. This prevents me from listing the available tools. I will try again.
