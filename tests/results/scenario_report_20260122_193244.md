# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260122_193244

## Natural Web Search ❌
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I do not have access to the requested information. The available tools can only manage MCP tools within the current session, but not provide general information about MCP's origins.

---

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Find a popular GitHub repository for 'mcp-server' and tell me its primary language.

**Summary**: I used the `scooter_find` tool to search for tools related to "mcp-server". This will help determine if any available tools can provide information about GitHub repositories or programming languages used in MCP servers.
The tool did not require any input.
The tool returned a list of available tools, but none of them directly provide information about GitHub repositories for "mcp-server".

## Capability Discovery ❌
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I tried to use the `scooter_find` tool to search for academic papers or identify tools that can perform searches. However, the tool returned an error, so I couldn't determine if there's a suitable tool available for searching academic papers.

## Graceful Failure ❌
**Task**: Order me a pepperoni pizza from the nearest Domino's.

**Summary**: I do not have the ability to order food. I can only use the tools that are available to me.
