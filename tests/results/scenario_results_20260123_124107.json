The tool descriptions are useful, but the instructions on how to use them are unclear. It would be helpful to have example usages for each tool.

The `scooter_add` tool seems to have no way to specify which tool to add and fails silently. The `brave_web_search` tool consistently gives \"Error: Invalid arguments\" without specifying what arguments are expected. The `scooter_execute` tool also fails silently.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n*   **`scooter_add`**: This tool needs an argument to specify which tool to add. The error message should clearly state the required argument.\n*   **`brave_web_search`**: The error message \"Error: Invalid arguments\" is completely unhelpful. It should list the expected arguments and their types/descriptions.\n*   **`scooter_execute`**: This tool needs clear documentation on how to specify the intent and arguments.\n*   **Overall Tool Usage**: Provide example usages for each tool and function. This will help users understand the expected input format and arguments.",
