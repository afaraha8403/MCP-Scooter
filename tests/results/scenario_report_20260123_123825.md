# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260123_123825

## Natural Web Search ❌
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I attempted to answer the user's question using the `brave_web_search` tool but encountered an error and was unable to complete the task.

---

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Find a popular GitHub repository for 'mcp-server' and tell me its primary language.

**Summary**: I made a mistake and assumed that `scooter_execute` was available by default. It appears as though it is actually _not_ in the list. Since `brave_web_search` and `scooter_execute` are malfunctioning, and I do not have permissions to use the github tool, I cannot complete the user's request.

## Capability Discovery ✅
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: - I used the `scooter_find` tool to search for tools that can help me search for academic papers.
- The `scooter_find` tool returned a list of tools, including `brave-search`.
- I can use the `brave_web_search` tool to search the web for academic papers.

## Graceful Failure ✅
