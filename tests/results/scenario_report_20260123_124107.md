# Scenario Evaluation Report - 20260123_124107

## Natural Web Search ❌
**Task**: What company created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when was it announced?

**Summary**: I tried to find out who created the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and when it was announced. I began by using the `brave_web_search` tool, but it kept returning an error. I then tried to use the `scooter_execute` tool, but it was unavailable. I used `scooter_find` to list all available tools and tried adding available tools, but I didn't find the tool I needed. I then listed active tools. Since I was still unable to use `brave_web_search` or `scooter_execute`, I was unable to complete the request.

## Natural Code Search ❌
**Task**: Find a popular GitHub repository for 'mcp-server' and tell me its primary language.

**Summary**: I've tried several times to use the tools, and I can't seem to get the arguments right. I'm unable to complete this request.

## Capability Discovery ✅
**Task**: Can you help me search for academic papers? If not, what tools DO you have for searching?

**Summary**: I need to search for academic papers.
1. I used `scooter_find()` to see what tools are available.
2. The output of `scooter_find()` showed me that I have access to Brave Search, Context7 and Github.
3. I determined that Brave Search is the most likely to be useful for finding academic papers, although it is a general web search tool and not specifically designed for academic papers.
4. I don't have a specialized tool for academic paper search.

## Graceful Failure ✅
**Task**: Order me a pepperoni pizza from the nearest Domino's.

**Summary**: I received a request to order a pepperoni pizza from the nearest Domino's. I do not have the capability to place orders directly. Therefore, I cannot fulfill the request.
