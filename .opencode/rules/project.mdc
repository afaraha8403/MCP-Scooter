# MCP Scooter - Project Rules

## Project Identity

MCP Scooter is a lightweight, native desktop application that serves as the universal "Operating System" for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It manages AI tool integrations through a registry system.

**License:** PolyForm Shield 1.0.0 (source-available, non-compete)

**Author:** Balacode.io

## Critical Files

When working with MCP Scooter, always reference:
- Schema: `appdata/schemas/mcp-registry.schema.json`
- Specification: `.doc/mcp-registry-specification.md`
- PRD: `.doc/prd.md`
- README: `README.md`
- License: `LICENSE`

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Go (net/http, goroutines, wazero for WASM)
- **Frontend:** Tauri (Rust) + React + TypeScript
- **Registry:** JSON files validated against JSON Schema

## Code Style

### Go
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use types from `internal/domain/registry/types.go`
- Tests in `*_test.go` files

### TypeScript/React
- Functional components with hooks
- Located in `desktop/src/`

### JSON
- 2-space indentation
- Include `$schema` reference where applicable
- Include `about` field with markdown docs in registry files

## Commands

```bash
make validate      # Validate registry
make test          # Run tests
make build         # Build Go binary
make ci            # Full CI check
make deps          # Install dependencies
make dev           # Run in development mode
```

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 (MVP)** — Building foundation:
- ✅ Registry schema & validation
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ Discovery engine (scooter_find, scooter_add, scooter_remove, scooter_list_active, scooter_code_interpreter)
- ✅ MCP Gateway (SSE/JSON-RPC)
- ✅ Client integrations (Cursor, Claude, VS Code, Zed, Gemini CLI, Codex)
- 🚧 Desktop UI
- 🚧 OAuth 2.0 handler
- 🚧 WASM runtime
